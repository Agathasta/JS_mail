TECHNOLOGIES USED

* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT
* (PYTHON & DJANGO were part of the distribution code)

What I learned:  

* Git: branch off a part of the work, in this case the CSS.
* CSS: implement the whole background layout on a grid. And make it responsive.
* JS: change the background of the button clicked and reset the background of the others.
* Fetch data and do things with it
